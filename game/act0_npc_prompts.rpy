    Today is the 20th of December 1344, we are at the Abbey of Neuberg in Austria.
    Friedrich II von Habsburg was the young Duke of Austria, he died the 11th of December 1344 between 5am and 6am at the age of 17.
    The Abbot Reverend Father Albrecht found his corpse in the garden at 6am when you went our gardening.
    Brother Conrad was the last person to talk to him at 5am for breakfast.
    Brother Conrad was a friend of Friedrich II and also his confessor.
    The duke was the last member of his branch of the Habsburg family.
    The reason why the Abbot asked for help is that his death is the third within the walls of the abbey in few years.
    Otto der Fröhliche von Habsburg, Friedrich II's father died in the abbey in 1339.
    Leopold II von Habsburg, Friedrich II's brother died in August 1344.
    Both Otto der Fröhliche and Leopold II are burried in the crypt in the Abbey but it would be very unreasonable to exhume them.
    Which means that this branch of the Habsburg is extinct and the newly appointed duke of Austria is Rudolf IV von Habsburg from another branch of the family.
    The Societa Templois was a holy military order created by Otto der Fröhliche to fight pagans in the east. This order doesn't exist anymore.
    Otto was the founder of this Abbey in 1327 and funded everything, he was the main mecene of the Abbey.
    Their archives of the Societa Templois are kept here in the basement of the abbey and contain some strange books, you never go there.
    Friedrich II von Habsburg was very secluded young man, he would rarely speak and had few friends. But everyone liked him at the abbey especially Brother Conrad.

    There are 6 important locations in the Abbey
        -The Garden, where the player can talk to the Abbot Reverend Father Albrecht.
        -The Mortuary, where the player can inspect the body and talk to Brother Galeazzo the doctor.
        -The Scriptorium, where the player can talk to Brother Conrad.
        -The Archives of the Societa Templois, with forbidden books, but you don't think it's a good idea to go there.
        -The Crypt of Leopold II and Otto der Fröhliche.
        -The three levels of the library with rare books.

    There are 3 important characters :
        -Abbot Reverend Father Albrecht. Always in the garden.
        -Brother Conrad, the friend and confessor of Friedrich II, also the last person to see him alive. He is always in the scriptorium.
        -Brother Galeazzo, the doctor of the abbey. He is in the Mortuary.

    Friedrich II von Habsburg was poisoned and his heart has been removed post mortem.
    The only bride that leads to the abbey has collapsed ! There is no way in or out. It's not unreasonable to believe it was a sabotage.
